## Type Checking
Type checking is a process of verifying that a variable or expression has the expected type. Dart is a strongly-typed language, which means that the type of a variable or expression must be known at compile-time. Dart uses a type inference system, whcich means that the type of a variable or expression is often inferred from the value assigned to it.

For example, the following code assigns the value `42` to the variable `x` and the type of `x` is inferred to be `int`:
```dart
var x = 42;
```
## Type Test Operators
In dart, you can check the type of variable at runtime using the `is` keyword. When you don't pass any data to a variable it is defined as 'dynamic' by default.
